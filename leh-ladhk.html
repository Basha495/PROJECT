                ABSTRACT 
                After the Paris Climate Conference (COP21), many countries start progressing towards carbon neutrality targets. 
                In doing so, green technology innovations (GTIs) and clean energy are the essential factors that can help to 
                achieve the carbon neutrality goal. Therefore, this paper examines the linkages between green technology 
                innovation and renewable energy and carbon dioxide emissions based on the STIRPAT model in Turkey during 
                the time of 1990–2018. The study used testing like “unit-root” to verify the variables’ integrative properties 
                containing the information for structural breaks. Also, the bootstrapping ARDL-bound testing technique is used 
                to analyze the relationship between the variables. The causal relationship between green technology innovation, 
                energy consumption, renewable energy, population, income per capita, and carbon dioxide emissions is tested 
                through a Granger causality test. The empirical findings show that green technology innovation, renewable 
                energy, energy consumption, population, income per capita, and carbon dioxide emissions are co-integrated for 
                the long-term association. Additionally, green technology innovation and renewable energy decline carbon di￾oxide emissions, whereas energy consumption, population, and per capita enhance carbon emissions. This paper 
                helps the policymakers design a comprehensive policy for strengthening environmental sustainability through 
                green technology innovation and renewable energy, specifically in the region of Turkey. 
                1. Introduction 
                Every country in the world needs to be consistent with its endow￾ment of energy resources and employment of socially equitable tech￾nologies with a minimum adverse impact on nature (Umar et al., 2020a; 
                2020b; Su et al., 2020). However, the intolerable degradation of the 
                natural environment through the usage of fossil fusil could only be 
                mitigated by dissociating the energy demand from economic growth and 
                the reduction of fossil fuels (Umar et al., 2021a). During the last decade, 
                one of the significant contributions of (Aswathanarayana and Divi, 
                (2009); Su et al., (2012)) has provided an informed choice to various 
                economies about the energy technologies and energy sources to attain 
                low-carbon economic growth. Simultaneously, the world econom

            <p>Energy TFP measurement needs to focus not only on the desired output but also on the undesired output. Based on the consideration of environmental factors, energy TFP measurement involves two aspects of the output: desired output and undesired output. The desired output refers to the output, such as GDP, which can increase human material products and services to a certain extent. The undesired output refers to additional products that have a negative effect on the human environment and health due to the consumption of energy and other elements in the production process, such as the greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide emissions in the production process. Too many studies have mainly focused on the contribution of energy to economic development, with less consideration on the impact of energy consumption on environmental quality, that is, ignoring the issue of the relationship between energy consumption and sustainable development. With the increasing prominence of environmental problems, more and more studies have included environmental factors into the consideration of energy TFP measurement to reduce the deviation in the process of energy TFP measurement (Zhang et al., 2011; He et al., 2013; Yang and Wang, 2013; Simsek, 2014; Vlontzos et al., 2014). Environmental regulation significantly promotes green technology innovation and reduces environmental pollution in the process of economic development (Du et al., 2021). Hu and Wang (2006) constructed a full-factor energy efficiency analysis framework to maximize the energy TFP output to improve energy TFP, which means that improving energy TFP should not only increase the desired output but also pay attention to the weakening of the undesired output. Environmental regulation can reduce the undesired output such as carbon dioxide, while improving energy TFP through technological innovation can play an essential role and have global strategic significance.
